The program takes two numbers as input and performs the following arithmetic operations:
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division

Example:
---------
Let:
    Please Enter First Number = 10
    Please Enter First Number = 5

Then the results will be:

    Addition : 15
    Subtraction :  5
    Multiplication : 50
    Division : 2.0

Task 2: Full Name Concatenation and Greeting
--------------------------------------------
The program takes a first name and a last name as input, concatenates them to form a full name, and then displays a greeting message.

Example:
---------
Let:
    First Name = "John"
    Last Name = "The Don"

Then the program will output:
    Full Name: John The Don
    Greeting: Hello, John The Don! Welcome to the Python Program
